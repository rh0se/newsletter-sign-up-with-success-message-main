## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- DOM Manipulation:
The success state, where users see a message after submitting the form, allowed me to practice DOM manipulation. I used JavaScript to dynamically update the content based on user input.

- CSS Styling and Layout:
Adapting the layout for different screen sizes (responsive design) was crucial.

- Dialog Element:
The challenge introduced me to the ```<dialog>``` element.
I explored its usage for displaying success messages and handling user interactions.

- Attention to Detail:
Matching my solution as closely as possible to the provided design helped me train my eye for detail.
I paid attention to fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment.

```html
<dialog>
  <form method="dialog"></form>
  </dialog>
```
```css
  dialog:not([open]){
          display:none;
     }
```


### Continued development
- Responsive Design Refinement:
Iâ€™ll practice making my designs more responsive.Testing across various devices and screen sizes will help me create adaptable layouts.

- JavaScript Proficiency: 
I plan to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. Exploring more complex interactions, form validation, and dynamic content will be my focus.
